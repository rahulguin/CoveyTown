# Changes to back-end

In order to support both our Placeables and Permissions features we made many changes and additions to the back-end code.

## Towns

Added a list of placeables to the townController to allow each town to have a reference to all the placeables that have been created in it.
It represents the definitive list of all placeables that a room has.
Placeables are current assumed to be unique based on position (since they are currently both stationary and no two placeables can occupy the same location)
and so reference to specific placeables are found from their location.
This feature could be changed by assigning placeables all a unique ID to allow for potential future advancement

## Placeables class

We created a placeable class that represents a placeable object in the town.
This class currently stores information that the placeable needs to know
placeableID, name, townID, InputInformation, and location
and has defined constants of how to represent the empty Placeable (what is assumed to be in every tile there is currently nothing)

This class was designed in a way to be easily extendable both in functionality and fields.

## Players

In order to support permissions players now have an added field 'canPlace' that is used to store if a specific player canPlace or delete placeables.
We hope this design of making permissions part of the players themselves will make it easy to both track and extend. 

Track: once a programmer has a reference to the player on the backend they will already have a reference to all of those players permissions <br />
Extend: such as wanting a permission to updateTown could be added as well.

# New API Methods

## addPlaceable

**Path**: POST /placeables/:townID <br />
**Data**: placeableID, location, inputInformation, townPassword, playerSessionToken <br />
**Description**: Adds the placeable (created fromt the provided information) to the town with the given townID. Is only sucessful if either the player provides the correct password associated with that town or provides a sessionToken that references a player that has permissions to add placeables in that town.
Will return a fail status if there is already a placeable in the town at the provided location

## deletePlaceable

**Path**: DELETE /placeables/:townID <br />
**Data**: location, townPassword, playerSessionToken <br />

## getPlaceable

**Path**: GET /placeables/:townID <br />
**Data**: location <br />
**Description**: Get the information of the placeable in the town associated with the provided id at the given location.
If there is no placeable at the provided location it will return the information assocaited with the empty placable at that location

## getPlayersPermission

**Description**: Gets if the provided player (from playerID) in the provided town (from townID) has permissions to add/delete Placables.
Will return a fail status if there the there is no town or associated with the given townID or playerID respectively.

## updatePlayerPermissions

Will return a fail status and not update any values if:

- There is no town associated with the provided id
- The password provided does not match the update password of the town
- A players ID is duplicated in the list
- The list contains a players ID that does not exist in the town

# Sockets

Two sockets emits have been created for placeables that are both sent from the server to all players:

## placeableAdded

A socket connection sent from the sever to every player when a placeable has successfully been added - including the player that made the request to add.
Contains the information of the placeable that was just added so players can add them

## placeableDeleted

A socket connection sent from the sever to every player when a placeable has successfully been deleted - including the player that made the request to add.
Contains the information of where the placeable was deleted from so players can remove the placeable they have at that location.

# Changes to front-end

In order to display both our Placeables and Permissions features we made many changes and additions to the front-end code.

## coveyAppState

The following fields are now being stored in the coveyAppState:
- placeables - Stores the list of placeables that have been placed in the current room.
- currentTownID - Stores the townID of the room we are currently in.
- apiClient - An object of TownServiceClient that provides the service calls used. The API calls for adding and deleting are used inside CoveyGameScene
- sessionToken - 

## WorldMap

## PermissionsButton

This component was created to display the Permissions button. This component is being rendered in the MenuBar component, so that it displays alongside the Town Settings and A/V Settings buttons. Clicking on the Permissions button opens up a Chakra UI Modal with options for entering password and changing player's permissions.
